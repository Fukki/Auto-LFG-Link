Because i am lazy to shout my LFG to find member with my self or macros :/</br>
</br>
Command:</br>
- autolfg [timer (ms)] [spam (times)] : auto shout your LFG link</br>
- autolfg party [msg] : post your LFG in party mode</br>
- autolfg raid [msg] : post your LFG in raid mode</br>
- autolfg : if non parameter will stop auto shout</br>
</br>
Example for use:</br>
- "autolfg 10000 3" : auto shout 3 times every 10 sec</br>
</br>
Issues:</br>
- You need to command again to stop auto shout</br>
- Auto shout ignore you have ready post LFG or not it just spam only</br>
- You can get shout block if you set after and more spam for good is 1/3000 (3 sec) or 2/6000 (6 sec)</br>
- Autolfg party/raid can post from everywhere like while in dungeon</br>
